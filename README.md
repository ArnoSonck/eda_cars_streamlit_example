This repository contains:

- `app.py` – The main Streamlit application that runs the EDA dashboard.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks used for experimentation and exploration during development.
- `vehicles_us.csv` – The dataset of vehicles used in the analysis.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies needed to run the app.

## 🌐 Live Demo

The app is deployed and accessible at:
